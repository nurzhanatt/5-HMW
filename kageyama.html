    <h1>TOBIO KAGEYAMA</h1>

    <h5>
      Kageyama's height and impressively sharp glare are said to be his most
      prominent physical features and source of attraction to several female
      classmates. He is of a lean but muscular build. He often emits an
      intimidating aura, which is heightened by the almost permanent scowl on
      his face. His black hair is cropped short, with a fringe that hangs just
      above his dark blue eyes. His typical attire consists of either his school
      uniform or practice clothes. Post-timeskip, Kageyama has grown to be 188
      cm. His hair is now parted down the middle similar to that of how Kunimi
      had his. By the end of the series, Kageyama now has short bangs that end
      just above his eyebrows.

    <h5>
      Perpetually sullen, arrogant, and undeniably short-tempered, Kageyama
      originally came off as a typical overbearing perfectionist, caring only
      about winning and completely disregarding the opinions and well-being of
      his teammates. His habit of complaining about their performance and
      barking orders at them eventually led the other players in Kitagawa
      Daiichi to nickname him the "King of the Court", a constant reminder of
      the oppressive, egocentric attitude he demonstrated during his volleyball
      career in junior high. Unbeknownst to the majority of his schoolmates and
      acquaintances, however, he is much more sensitive and childish than he
      appears to be; he simply does not know how to control his frustration, and
      hence expresses his thoughts and emotions in an inappropriate way. After
      everyone in Kitagawa Daiichi became fed up with him and abandoned his
      side, Kageyama was filled with genuine regret and developed an intense
      fear of being despised and mistrusted, but refused to openly discuss his
      problem until Tsukishima confronted him about it. Despite his inability to
      properly socialize, he sincerely wishes to do his best and is extremely
      passionate and dedicated when it comes to volleyball, to the point where
      he gets overly excited about nearly every successful move he pulls off
      with Hinata. Since joining Karasuno, he has grown to be more respectful of
      his upperclassmen, as well as more accepting of people whose abilities
      and/or views differ from his own, and has come to once again understand
      the importance of teamwork and mutual trust in the sport he treasures so
      much. Additionally, this has also helped him regain his confidence as a
      setter. He has also come to realize that he doesn't call the shots on the
      court, and has learned to give up control to Hinata and other spikers.
      During high school, he still gets extremely angry when he is called by his
      nickname, "King of the Court", but, by the Final Arc, he has changed
      greatly on how he views the nickname.
